            When bikers are cycling on road, it is often there's no bycycle lanes on the side. This forces the bikers to face a huge risk of getting struck by the vehicles rushing by. To reduce the amount of fatal accidents those bikers may encounter, we developed a power efficient bicycle signal system that shows various lighting patterns when bikers make turns and brakes.
