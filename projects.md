## [Multi-Style Sematic Style Transfer](pushUps.md)

            This project is aimed to transfer different semantic objects in one image into different styles. We use pretrained semantic segmentation model (DeepLab-V3) to get the foregound and backgound region, and apply style transfer on different style for each region. In addition to style loss and content loss in traditional neural style transfer, we futher add style-blending loss and total variance loss to make the result more harmony when blending very different style. Also, we provide custom control of blending effect.

            The project aims to solve the problem of controlling the input/output flow of a pumping system. It utilizes PID control to achieve a precise and automatic adjustment during operation, and includes an user-friendly HMI allow for monitoring and parameter changing.

            [UIST '19 @ New Orleans] FaceWidgets is a novel HMD that integrates physical controls with a lift extender on the backside allowing for the direct manipulation for the VR interaction. We designed two novel interactions to enhance direct manipulation and conducted three user studies to inform the design on the HMD backside.

            The VR showcase "Hunting for Khubilai Khan" allows the audience to dive into the boundless desert, and hunt down the preys. The player plays as the Khubilai Khan, and experience the intense and fun of hunting by sitting on the horse-riding machine, and a bow-simulating hand-held device.

            This creation takes place at the Jinming Pool in the Song Dynasty. Back then it was a huge pool in the royal garden of Kaifeng; the royal family used to enjoy the beauty and fish by the pool bank. In our showcase the player becomes a member of the imperial family, and fish leisurely with actually feeling of the fish's struggle.

            When bikers are cycling on road, it is often there's no bycycle lanes on the side. This forces the bikers to face a huge risk of getting struck by the vehicles rushing by. To reduce the amount of fatal accidents those bikers may encounter, we developed a power efficient bicycle signal system that shows various lighting patterns when bikers make turns and brakes.
