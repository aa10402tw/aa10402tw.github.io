## [Multi-Style Sematic Style Transfer](pushUps.md)

<div

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th
        class = "imageColumn">
        <img

        class = "textColumn">
            This project is aimed to transfer different semantic objects in one image into different styles. We use pretrained semantic segmentation model (DeepLab-V3) to get the foregound and backgound region, and apply style transfer on different style for each region. In addition to style loss and content loss in traditional neural style transfer, we futher add style-blending loss and total variance loss to make the result more harmony when blending very different style. Also, we provide custom control of blending effect.

            Hyper-parameters optimization problem is aimed to find the most suitable hyper-parameters for training neural network. This project use Grid Search, Random Search and Evoluationary Search to tackle hyper-parameters optimization problem, and use CUDA-Awared MPI (Distributed Computing) to accerlate the process. We achieve 3.65 to 3.8 speed up under 4 nodes.

            The VR showcase "Hunting for Khubilai Khan" allows the audience to dive into the boundless desert, and hunt down the preys. The player plays as the Khubilai Khan, and experience the intense and fun of hunting by sitting on the horse-riding machine, and a bow-simulating hand-held device.

            This creation takes place at the Jinming Pool in the Song Dynasty. Back then it was a huge pool in the royal garden of Kaifeng; the royal family used to enjoy the beauty and fish by the pool bank. In our showcase the player becomes a member of the imperial family, and fish leisurely with actually feeling of the fish's struggle.

            When bikers are cycling on road, it is often there's no bycycle lanes on the side. This forces the bikers to face a huge risk of getting struck by the vehicles rushing by. To reduce the amount of fatal accidents those bikers may encounter, we developed a power efficient bicycle signal system that shows various lighting patterns when bikers make turns and brakes.
