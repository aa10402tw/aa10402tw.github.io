# About

## Keywords: CS, NCTU, Taiwan / HCI / Computer Engineering / Foodie

## Bio:

I'm David, a new grad from the **Institute of Multimedia Engineering** of National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan. My research area was **Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)**, and focused on exploring possible interaction between real world and the virtual world.  

I persued my bachelor's degree in the department of **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** of NCTU, from which I gained EE-related knowledge such as circuit design. Since I switched to the area of Computer Science for my master's degree, I therefore consider myself more as a **computer engineer** rather than a pure hardware engineer or a computer scientist.

Beside working, what I enjoy in my free time are reading and all the good food. I also like to cook, and love to spend plenty of time on discussing what's the recipe of a cusine with others. In my opinion, food is the best common language that all human kind share, and the best way to make friends.
