## Statement of Purpose  

According to the department of National Highway Safety Administration, there were 726 fatal automobile accidents involving bicycle riders(2017). Despite sharing the road with cars, most bicycles do not have break or turn light signals.  
&nbsp;  
Although wearing safety gear such as helmets can reduce these fatalities, an automated brake/turn signal system would reduce the number of accidents by increasing a bicycleâ€™s visibility and establishing communication between cyclists and motorists. While there are products that perform the same functions, these solutions are not easy to install or quick to remove.  
&nbsp;  

## Unique Features

Our proposed design will be different from current available designs in several aspects. The design will include automatic brake light control and automatic turn light shutoff. The system will also be very power efficient allowing for extremely long run times between recharge. The design should be compact to facilitate quick and easy removal for battery recharge.  
&nbsp;  
First of all, the mentioned features are currently not available in other solutions on the market. Secondly, the cost of all the components used in our design must be low. This low production cost combined with our unique features will make our design extremely marketable.
